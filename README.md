# how-to-build-shlaer-mellor-class-models

I originally published this book through Prentice-Hall back in 1997.

Then I re-wrote it in 2001 as `How to Build Executable UML` models in 2002 to make it UML-friendly.

In 2017 I begain updating the 2002 edition for possible re-publication.

Soon after I got a lucrative new day job which temporarily shelved, no pun intended, those plans.

Here it is 2022 and I think the book would look pretty cool fully udpated in a github wiki.

Let's see how that turns out.
